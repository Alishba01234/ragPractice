Common factors \\ncontributing to brain drain include limited career \\nopportunities, low salaries, lack of benefits, poor \\nquality of life, political instability, and crime \\nconditions. The recent wave of political instability in \\nPakistan has resulted in the migration of \\napproximately 832,339 highly skilled individuals, \\nincluding healthcare professionals, since the year 2\\n2022.\\nAccording to the Bureau of Emigration & Overseas \\nEmployment, Pakistan lost around one million \\nAptitude of Medical Students Towards their Postgraduate Medical Education at \\nMultan; Brain Drain in Pakistan\\n1 2 3 4\\nIrum Qureshi,  Muhammad Ahmed Khokhar,  Zaitoon Sarfaraz,  Hafiz Muhammad Yar\\nAbstract \\nObjective: To investigate the factors influencing medical students\\' decisions to pursue their Post Graduate \\nMedical Education (PGME) in Pakistan or abroad, and to examine the differences in preferences between \\nstudents from government and private medical colleges.\\nMaterial and Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted from January to July 2024 among \\n300 medical students in their 4th and final year of MBBS from four different medical colleges in Multan.

The majority of Pakistani students seeking \\npost-graduate medical education (PGME) opt for \\ncountries such as the USA, UK, Australia, and \\nCanada.\\nNotably, approximately 23-28% of the medical \\nworkforce in these countries consists of International 4\\nMedical Graduates (IMGs).  Pakistan produces \\naround 30,000 medical graduates annually but \\nstruggles to retain them due to the loss of doctors to \\ndeveloped nations such as the UK and the US. An \\nestimated six million highly skilled professionals, \\nincluding healthcare workers, have left Pakistan \\nbetween 1971 and 2022. If policy changes are not 5\\nimplemented, these numbers may continue to rise.\\nAdditionally, according to the National Health \\nService (NHS) in the UK, as of 2021, 14% of \\nspecialist doctors are from Asian nationality, with 6\\ntwo-thirds being of Pakistani or Indian origin.  After \\ncompleting their medical studies, students are \\npresented with various pathways to pursue their \\npostgraduate medical education (PGME). The \\nprimary options are to study in Pakistan or abroad and \\nto achieve their professional goals, they must pass \\nassessment exams specific to the country they wish to \\npursue their career in. For instance, students seeking \\nto practice in the United States must take the \\nUSMLE, while those aiming to work in the UK must 7,8\\npass the PLAB exam.\\nSimilarly, medical councils in Australia and Canada \\nadminister their own licensing exams for 9,10\\ninternational medical graduates.  In Pakistan, most \\nstudents opt for the FCPS exam to continue their 11\\nPGME . Other options include MCPS, MS, M.Phil., \\nand MPH. Given the current state of the medical \\nprofession in Pakistan, with declining employment \\nrates and increasing numbers of graduates, job \\nsecurity is a major concern for medical graduates. \\nFurthermore, Pakistan\\'s healthcare system ranks \\n130th out of 195 countries worldwide, and its health 12\\nexpenditure was only 3.38% of its GDP in 2019.\\nIt is not surprising that many medical students and \\nphysicians choose to pursue a career abroad in search \\nof better working conditions. With an increasing \\nnumber of students pursuing postgraduate education \\nabroad, it is essential to understand the factors \\ndriving this trend and its impact on healthcare \\nsystems in both home and host countries.\\nPakistan faces a severe shortage of doctors due to its \\nlarge population, making it essential to understand \\nthe reasons behind medical graduates\\' choices. This \\nstudy was conducted to provide quantitative data on \\nthe number of students inclined towards pursuing \\nPGME abroad or staying in Pakistan, as well as the \\nfactors influencing their decisions. The primary \\nobjectives of this study were to determine the \\naptitude of medical students towards PGME and the \\nfactors contributing to their choice of different career \\npathways.\\nMaterial and Methods\\nAn online Google survey was conducted from \\nJanuary to July 2024 at four medical colleges in \\nMultan, comprising two government and two private th\\nmedical colleges, targeting 4  and final-year MBBS \\nstudents from the year 2023. The sample size was \\ncalculated to be 329, using a prevalence of 31% of \\nmigratory intentions from previous research and a \\n95% confidence interval with 5% margin of error. \\nAfter obtaining approval from the Institutional \\nReview Board of the college (IRB case no. \\nTW/51/CIMS) dated 29-12-2023, the questionnaire \\nwas sent to eligible students, and 300 responses were \\ncollected, resulting in a response rate of 91.1%. The \\nquestionnaire included socio-demographic \\ninformation about the participants as well as their \\nintentions to stay in Pakistan or move abroad, based \\non their personal preferences. A five-point Likert \\nscale was used to record the reasons or factors behind \\ntheir intentions for post-graduation, ranging from \\n\"strongly disagree\" to \"strongly agree\".

Medicine is no doubt one of the most\\nrevered and the noblest professions among various career\\nchoices.\\n1\\nMedicine is regarded as the best career choice in\\ndeveloping countries like Pakistan. Many young Pakistani\\nstudents nurture the dream of becoming doctors, driven\\nby the noble aspiration of contributing positively to society.\\nSome individuals are drawn towards the profession due to\\na genuine aﬃnity for the field, their innate curiosity about\\nthe human body, and because of their enthusiasm to\\nalleviate human suﬀering.\\n2Others find themselves on this\\npath due to parental expectations, striving to honour their\\nfamily’s legacy3or upholding a family tradition of academic\\nexcellence. This pressure leads to undue stress, burnout and\\nlack of motivation among medical students.\\nAlso, for some, the prospect of financial stability and\\nprosperity forms a compelling incentive, prompting them\\nto envision medicine as a lucrative avenue. They aspire to\\nbecome doctors for a better lifestyle and high social status.4\\nChances and opportunities also play a crucial role in career\\nchoices. Some find themselves in the world of medicine\\ndue to a fortunate alignment of circumstances — an\\nunforeseen twist of fate that steers them onto this path.\\nThere is a relative literature gap about the motivational\\nfactors responsible for career decisions of medical students\\nin Pakistan. The current study was planned to fill the gap\\nby determining the factors influencing medical students’\\ndecisions to pursue a career in medicine, and to assess their\\nlevel of satisfaction with their decision.\\nSubjects and Methods\\nThe descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted at the\\nNishtar Medical University (NMU), Multan, Pakistan, from\\nJuly to October 2023.

This was owing to financial constraints that did\\nnot permit a multicentre approach. Additionally, the\\nfindings cannot be generalised due to a potential selection\\nbias in the study design.\\nConclusion\\nMost of the students had been compelled by their parents\\nto pursue a career in medicine due to its esteemed status\\nand societal pressure. There is a need to address the issue.\\nIf neglected, this pressure can lead to demotivation and a\\nlack of empathy among medical students.

The sufferers are competent objectively but \\nthey have a secret fear in  them, that they are inade -\\nquate in the skills and knowledge and this secret will \\nbe open to others anytime. It is strongly associated \\nwith burnout phenomenon, anxiety, depression, many \\nother psychological effects and many significant \\nimplications on medic al education and training. Suf -\\nfering students develop different styles of learning and \\nfind it difficult to learn through conventional or usual \\nteaching strategies. \\nObjectives:  This study objective was to find out the \\nfrequency of IS among Pakistani medical students. \\n \\n \\n \\n1 Professor of Medicine, Azra Naheed Medical College, Lahore \\n2 Consultant Physician, Khafji General Hospital, Kingdom of Saudi \\nArabia \\n3 Associate Professor of Community Medicine, Azra Naheed \\nMedical College, Lahore \\n4 Associate Professor of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Azra Naheed \\nMedical College, Lahore \\n5 Professor of Paediatrics \\n Khawaja Muhammad Safdar Medical College, Sialkot \\n6 Principal & HOD Department of Medicine, Associate Professor \\nof Community Medicine, Azra Naheed Medical College, Lahore \\n \\nDate of Submission: 21-01-2017 \\nDate of Acceptance for Publication: 07-02-2017 \\nConflict of Interest: None \\nFunding Source: None \\n \\nContribution \\nAll Authors have contributed in Study Design, Data Collection, \\nData Analysis, Data Interpretation, Manuscript  Writing and Appr-\\noval. \\nMethodology:  This was a cross sectional, descriptive \\nstudy, conducted in a private medical college of \\nLahore, Pakistan in November 2016.

To cope these, the y devote \\nmore of their time, energies, resources, attention  and \\nmotivation. These situations may lead to a well-known \\n“Burnout Phenomenon” .2 This phenomenon is asso -\\nciated with absenteeism and even may lead t o medical \\nerrors.3 Imposter syndrome is now a well-known entity \\nand because of its association to burnout phenomenon, \\nrecently it is gaining popularity in literature.4-7 \\n The psychological researchers Pauline Clance and \\nSuzanne Imes were the first one to coin this term, \\n“Imposter Syndrome, in 1978. They observed that \\nsome high achievers secret ly have this sense  that they \\ncannot meet the expectations of others. They give the \\ncredit of their successes to the luck or ch ance instead \\nof their abilities .8 The sufferers also have a fear that \\nthey will be exposed as incompetent in front of others. \\nSo a person with impos ter syndrome or phenomenon \\nfeels like a fake, attributing the successes to the luck, \\ndiscounting their significance.9 \\n Students are one of the high risk groups for this \\nsyndrome. Students suffering from Imposter Synd -\\nrome develop feelings of self -doubt and have fear that \\nthey will be discovered by others as a person with inte-\\nllectual fraud. As they consider themselves as less \\ncompetent and intelligent than perceived by their \\ncolleagues, teachers, relatives and society. These suf -\\nferers fail to convince themselves that they are compe-\\ntent, skill full and have accomplished the goal by \\nvirtue of their abilities, which they actually possess 2. \\nOverall, they believe themselves to be less intelligent \\nand competent than others perceive them to be. 10 Imp-\\noster syndrome is associated with anxiety, low level of \\nself-esteem, lack of confidence and a labile self -con-\\ncept.11 \\n Henning et al did a study in 1998 on Medical, \\ndental, pharmacy and nursing students, and found 30 \\npercent of these scoring as imposters. The imposte r \\nsyndrome was considered as the most important pre -\\ndictor for generalized psychological stress. Oriel et al \\nconducted a study on the residents of family medicine \\nwho knew that they are going through the training pro -\\ngram which is essential for their succe ss and conclu -\\nded that almost one third had imposterism.12 \\n Imposter syndrome has many significant implicat -\\nions on medical education and training. The sufferers \\nare usually shy to initiate a conversation or speak out \\nor volunteer answers or describe facts  during a class, \\nacademic activity or even day to day candid conversat -\\nions. Because of this hesitancy they develop different \\nstyles of learning and find it difficult to learn through \\nconventional or usual teaching strategies. \\n This study was designed to f ind out the frequency \\nof imposter syndrome among final year students of a \\nprivate medical college so that special strategies may \\nbe suggested to improve the teaching and learning \\nstrategies as well as the curriculum. \\n \\n \\nMethodology \\nThis was a cross sectional, descriptive study conducted \\nin a private medical college of Lahore, Pakistan in \\nNovember 2016. After approval from institutional \\nReview Board, one hundred and f ifty (150) final year \\nMBBS students from both genders were enrolled in \\nthe study. Study setti ng was a private medical college \\nof Lahore, Pakistan. Sampling technique was conve -\\nnient non-probability type. After verbal informed con -\\nsent all the students were briefly introduced to the \\nstudy and were asked to complete the anonymous self-\\nadministered printed questionnaires. The eight item s, \\nYoung Imposter Scale (YIS) was used to do the dicho -\\ntomous assessment of imposter syndrome, whether \\npresent or absent .2 It is in the form of questions and a \\nstudent was considered positive for Imposter synd -\\nrome if he/she answered 5 or more questions as “Yes”. \\nStatistical analysis was done through SPSS Version 20 \\nsoftware (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). \\n \\n \\nResults \\nOne hundred and fifty (150) students were selected for \\nthe study and were asked to return the complete d 08 \\nitems questionnaire. One hundred and forty three stu -\\ndents returned the questionnaires, so the response rate \\nwas 95.33%. Out of these 143 students 84 were fema -\\nles (58.7%) and 59 males (41.3%). The overall mean \\nage of the respondents was 24.08  ± 1.051 years whe-\\nreas mean age of male students was 24.05  ± 1.121 and \\nof female students was 24.11  ± 1.006 years  respec-\\ntively. \\n Gender wise details of the answers of all the eight \\nquestions by respondents are given in the table 1. \\n The students who answered “Yes” for five or more \\nout of eight questions were considered  positive for \\nImposter Syndrome .2 Sixty eight out of 143 stude nts \\n(47.5%) answered “Yes” for five  or more questions. \\nOut of the 68 students positive for imposter syndrome \\n45 (53.5%) were females and  23 (38.9%) were males. \\nGender wise Young Impo ster Scores are given in  \\ntable 2.'),\n",

But the subsequent studies showed that this \\nphenomenon is also quite frequent  among males, and \\nmany studies showed no significant difference in the \\nfrequencies among genders. But most studies showed \\nfemales as relatively common sufferers, 10 especially \\nfrom younger age group. In our medical colleges, now \\na days, the females students  are two third or close to \\nthis of the total student population. This adds to the \\nsignificance of impacts of Imposter syndrome on \\nmedical education and trainings. \\n It is also found out that progress into senior classes \\nor senior training years  does not ha ve any effect on \\nimposter syndrome so if a student suffers, he/she will \\ncontinue suffering this syndrome despit e increase in \\neducation level, 10 unless treated specially through a \\ntailored and customized approach. \\n Out of all 08 questions, majority of stude nts whe-\\nther with imposter syndrome score or not, answered \\n“Yes” for the following two questions. Ninety eight \\nstudents (68.53%) accepted that they hate making a \\nmistake, being less than fully prepared or not doing \\nthings perfectly. As a result such studen ts are likely to \\navoid challenges and even decline many opportunities \\nwhere anyone is likely to make mistakes also. \\n More than half of the students are living with the \\nfear of being found out, discovered or un -masked by \\nothers as incapable and not bright. Their fear is con -\\ntrary to the obvious successes they have. The sufferers \\nof IS/IP are usually perfectionist, needing everything \\nat the best but also are afraid of the problems they \\nexpect to face in their interpersonal relations and the \\nshame they will fe el if their inadequacies will get \\nopen.13 \\n One hundred students (69.93%) do not believe that \\nother students are smarter and more capable then \\nthemselves. \\n IS/IP is associated with many psychological prob -\\nlems like depression, anxiety and mis -perceptions of  \\nself-abilities. It may act as a psychological barrier in \\npeople’s careers especially of women. 13,14 These com-\\nplex combined feelings usually hinder in the progress \\nin careers.14 thus understanding this phenomenon helps \\nin identifying those who are at risk of leaving the insti-\\ntution, or even may leave the profession feeling they \\nare not competent enough to cope with the institutional \\nor professional expectations.5 \\n Seventy five students ( 52.44%) said that they shy \\naway from challenges because they have dou bt on \\ntheir abilities. So they do not attribute the successes \\nthey get during their academic as well as practical life. \\nThese p eople are even in fear of success, as success \\nwill bring more responsibilities and expectations. They \\nstrongly feel that they are  not worthy of the praise and \\nappreciation they are receiving. At the same time they \\nare afraid of failure, being perfectionist and always \\nhaving successes in past, they cannot handle their fai -\\nlures. In addition they also have issues of self -esteem \\nand cannot handle criticism and constructive feedback. \\nEighty nine students (62.23%) confessed for feeling \\ncrushed even by constructive criticism, seeing it as an \\nevidence of their ineptness. These complex feelings \\nlead to anxiety, depression and many other personality \\nissues.13,14,16,17 \\n Students are not confident about their abilities and \\nteachers or administrations recognize the abilities of \\nthese individuals. So they give more and more respon -\\nsibilities and challenges to them but they feel incom -\\npetent or not  capable to cope with these, so there is \\nagain a mismatch between expectations and thus per -\\nformances due to lack of confidence. They even can -\\nnot feel confident that if they have done all this in past \\nwhy they can’t just repeat this in future. This is bec a-\\nuse they think themselves as intellectual frauds and \\nattribute their past successes to flukes. This conflicting \\nsituation causes a lot of stress, anxiety and fear.16,17 \\n Finding imposter syndrome or phenomenon in \\nmedical students who are close to the com pletion of \\ntheir student life can predict those at risk of facing \\ndifficulty in future during practical and professional \\nlives. This predictive value has brought “IS” in focus \\nof research recently. One rea son may be its strong \\nassociation with “burnout phe nomenon” and thus in -\\ncreasing number of quitting, and suicides in campuses. \\nSo many institutions have started developing intensive \\nprograms for help to these IS students. 2 These pro -\\ngrams help students to find out IS/IP tendencies, and \\nprograms to focus on  supporting such students. Many \\ninstitutions imposter programs are part of their orien -\\ntation activities. These programs help students finding \\nwhether they have the tendency or not and if yes, to \\njoin such programs. Workshops and activities may be \\ndeveloped to promote multicultural interactions, confi -\\ndence building, success defining and strength identify-\\ncations, dealing with failures and absorbing and utiliz -\\ning constructive feedbacks and criticism. Students may \\nbe trained to understand perfectionism and how to set \\nexpectations for them which are more reasonable and \\nachi-evable.18 \\n Similarly many programs should be developed for \\nthe faculty, staff and administration.

This may have detrimental effects on body, \\nmind, personalities and academic as well as profess -\\nional developments. Efforts should be made to find out \\nIS/IP among students and to train both students and \\nteachers. \\n \\n \\nReferences \\n1. Densen P. Challenges and opportunities facing medical \\neducation.
